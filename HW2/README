Please note: I aplogize for the poor doccumentation. My intentions were good in the begining but it ran out of time to finish my commenting scheme.

Another note: I'm not sure how you are going to test this with 100 clients. I had to write a testing class that spawned clients in threads. Please see the main in my Client.java to see how to make it run properly. First you make a Client, then you need to call sendMsg() on it and then listen(0 on it as well. Again, please see the client's main if you are invoking it from your own code. Thank you!
